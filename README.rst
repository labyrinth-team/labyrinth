Labyrinth
=========

Labyrinth is a lightweight mind-mapping tool, written in Python using Gtk and
Cairo to do the drawing.  It is intended to be as light and intuitive as
possible, but still provide a wide range of powerful features.

A mind-map is a diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks or other items
linked to and arranged radially around a central key word or idea. It is used
to generate, visualise, structure and classify ideas, and as an aid in study,
organisation, problem solving, and decision making. (From wikipedia)

Currently, Labyrinth provides 3 different types of thoughts, or nodes - Text,
Image and Drawing.  Text is the basic standard text node.  Images allow you to
insert and scale any supported image file (png, jpeg, svg).  Drawings are for
those times when you want to illustrate something, but don't want to fire up
a separate drawing program.  It allows you to quickly and easily sketch very
simple line diagrams.

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 2.6
* gtk+
* pygtk
* pygobject
* pycairo
* PyXDG

The minimum required versions are unknown, but any reasonably recent packages
should work.

How to use it
-------------

From the top directory of the package, run the command::

    ./labyrinth

You can also install Labyrinth with ``python setup.py install``, and
``./install_data_files.sh`` for icons and translations. It can then be run as
``labyrinth``.

This will open a browser window, showing you all the maps currently available
and allow you to modify / delete them and create new maps.  The title is
(currently) the primary thought text(truncated to 27 characters long).  This is
usually the first thought created in a new map.

In a new map, single click somewhere to create a new "thought".  This is your
root.  Add your main thought to this.  Click somewhere else will create a new
thought, linked to the first.  To move thoughts around, single-click and drag.
To edit a current thought, double click on it (text thoughts only).

Drawing and Image thoughts can be resized using their corners / sides.

Links between thoughts can be created, strengthened and weakened.  To create a
new link, in edit mode, click and drag from the "parent" thought to the "child"
thought while holding down the ctrl key.  Doing this with a link already in
place will strengthen the link by 1 and dragging from child to parent will
weaken the link by 1.  If the link goes to 0 strength (it starts at 2),
the link is deleted.  Links can also be created / deleted by selecting both
thoughts (hold down the shift key to select > 1 thought) and choosing
"Edit->(Un)Link Thoughts" from the menu (shortcut: Ctrl-L).

Loading and saving of maps is in the tomboy style - they are automatically
saved, you shouldn't have to worry about them.  For reference anyway, the maps
are saved in ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/labyrinth/<longstring>.map``. Please see the Freedesktop 
basedir specification for more information http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

Future Plans
------------

In ``doc/TheFuture``, there are a list of goals for a 1.0 release and for the next
release. Releases are feature-based at this stage. Once all the required
features are in place, a release is made.

However a release may also be made without all the changes if it is deemed
that this is in the best interest.
