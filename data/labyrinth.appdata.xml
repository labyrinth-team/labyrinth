        <p>
            Labyrinth is a lightweight mind-mapping tool, written in Python using Gtk and
            Cairo to do the drawing. It is intended to be as light and intuitive as
            possible, but still provide a wide range of powerful features.
        </p>

        <p>
            A mind-map is a diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks or other items
            linked to and arranged radially around a central key word or idea. It is used
            to generate, visualize, structure and classify ideas, and as an aid in study,
            organization, problem solving, and decision making (From Wikipedia).
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, Labyrinth provides 3 different types of thoughts, or nodes - Text,
            Image and Drawing. Text is the basic standard text node. Images allow you to
            insert and scale any supported image file (PNG, JPEG, SVG). Drawings are for
            those times when you want to illustrate something, but don't want to fire up a
            separate drawing program. It allows you to quickly and easily sketch very
            simple line diagrams.
